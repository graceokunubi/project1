Variable Fields: 

Time: createdate
Sample size: samplesize
Approval/Disapproval: adjusted_approve;adjusted_disapprove
Pollster: pollster 


1st. Visualization: Line Graph

- Differentiate pollster with color

- Time on the x-axis: First day of each month
- Approval on the y-axis
 - Approval + y 
 - Dissaproval -y 

- Each line will represent a different pollster overtime 


2nd Visualization: Scatter 

- Approval on the y-axis
 - Approval + y 
 - Dissaproval -y 
- Time on the x-axis: First day of each month
- Size of element indicative of sample size


Splitting up the Work: Code 

- Setting up the SVG + Axis 
- Configuring the data points 
- Coloring the code 

Splitting up the Work: Paper 
- Motivation: What's the point? What are you trying to say? 
- A description of the data. Report where you got the data. Describe the variables. If you had to reformat the data or filter it in any way, provide enough details that someone could repeat your results. 
- An overview of your design rationale. A good rule of thumb to follow is “every pixel must be justified.” Instead of a 100,000-element breakdown, give us an overview of the design decisions you made and the trade-offs inherent in how you displayed the data. 
    - Position
    - Color
    - Shape 
- What does your visualization tell us? What was surprising about it? What insights do you want to convey to the viewer of your visualization?
